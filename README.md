## <a name="Task">The Task</a>
Due to the climate crisis, more roads are being closed off. Scientists on climate change suggested in order to save our future we must reduce our carbon footprint â€” and cycling for transportation is one of them. The government announced investing a significant amount of money towards 'Boris Bikes' so that everyone can do their part for the planet, whilst also, keeping fit. Lucky you, you're offered the job to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and logistics) required to make their ambitious plans a reality.

### <a name="Story">User Story</a>
## 'User Stories' are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability,usually a user or a client of the system.

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like to get a bike from a docking station.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.

As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).
